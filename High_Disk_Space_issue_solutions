### High disk Space 
--------------------

Q.) How will you resolve High Disk space In Linux ?

A.) * Login to server
* df -h
* du -sh *
* cd max space directory path
* ls -larth
* ls -larth | grep G   
 #(extract GB files)
* df -h filename

Senerio-1.) You can zip large file, if it's dependent on any process. Just confirm with Developer & colleague)
* gzip -9 filename   #(zip  max space taking file)

Senerio-2.) If file is not dependent on any process & you'll have to remove it (confirm with Developer & Colleague) :-
* > filename   #( truncating, removing file's content the file because if we directly remove , the free space will not get added in disk immediately or you will have to reboot system to reflect)
* df -h filename
* du -sh filename
* df - h 
* rm - rf filename    #(remove truncated file, because empty file utilized by INODE)
* df -h

* Senerio-3.) You can remove the file after taking the backup in other Disk, other server or S3 bucket
